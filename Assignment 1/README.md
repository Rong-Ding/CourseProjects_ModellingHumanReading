word2vec_training_finalised.ipynb:
This script implements the training Word2Vec models of various parameter sets (of vector size and window).

Data preprocessing.ipynb:
This script preprocesses raw human data and transforms outputs of the trained Word2Vec models for stats analyses.

anova_cosine.R:
This script statistically compares the ANOVA model fit (across semantically highly and lowly correlated and uncorrelated words) over different parameter sets.

lme_priming_cosine.R:
This script computes and statistically compares the linear mixed-effect model fit (across different semantic correlation and inter-stimulus intervals) over different parameter sets.
